Atmega328p standalone "blink" project, using avr-hal (https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal.git), not ruduino. 

Derived from the examples given in the avr-hal github repo. All credit goes there.

It works on the bare "chip" on a breadboard, no special hardware, except wires, a led and a resistor. 
Needs some form of programmer, of course, i use a "buspirate". But a raspberry pi would to the job.
